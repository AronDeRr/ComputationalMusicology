My corpus consists of the 17 studio albums released by the band Fleetwood Mac. Also known in the earlier years as Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac. I choose this corpus, because Fleetwood Mac is my favorite musical artist and the band has topped my Spotify wrapped ever since I got a Spotify subscription a few years ago. 
I think this corpus will be interesting, because there have been a lot of changes to the bands line-up, especially in their earlier years. Below is a list of the albums and the band members that helped create the album. Only two band members, Mick Fleetwood (drums) and John McVie (bass), have been in the band since the start and have performed on every album. Which is why their names are not included in the list.

- Fleetwood Mac (1968) (Also known as Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac)
- Mr. Wonderful (1968)
- Then Play On (1969)
- Kiln House (1970)
- Future Games (1971)
- Bare Trees (1972)
- Penguin (1973)
- Mystery to Me (1973)
- Heroes Are Hard to Find (1974)
- Fleetwood Mac (1975) (Also known as "The White Album")
- Rumours (1977)
- Tusk (1979)
- Mirage (1982)
- Tango in the Night (1987)
- Behind the Mask (1990)
- Time (1995)
- Say You Will (2003)

The band started out as a blues band, but since the addition of Christine McVie after the album "Kiln House" the style of the band shifted to rock. I expect there to be quite a few differences between these earlier albums and the others. 
Their second self-titled album was the breakthrough for the band and got them global success. This was the first album released since the addition of the duo Lindsey Buckingham and Stevey Nicks. The members of the band that released this album is the most well known line-up and brought the band the most succes in the 5 albums they released as a core. It will be interesting to look at what this line-up did different, that brought them this success.
